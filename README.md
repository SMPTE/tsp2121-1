comments and issues for SMPTE Technical Specification 2121

When creating comments or raising issues. Please follow these guidelines:

This document is offered as a SMPTE Committee Draft (see [SMPTE Standards Operations Manual](https://www.smpte.org/sites/default/files/SMPTE%20Standards%20OM%20v3.1.pdf) ) put into the public domain.

A separate issue is required for each non-editorial issue. Any proposed change that you regard as essential must be labeled as **substantive** and you are **required** to propose specific actions and/or language that would resolve your objection. 

Editorial comments are informative and do not require a formal response by the project group for each suggestion. Multiple editorial changes may be suggested in a single issue.
