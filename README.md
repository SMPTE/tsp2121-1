Please follow these guidelines when raising issues:

* A separate issue is required for each non-editorial issue.
* Any proposed change that you regard as essential must be labeled as **substantive** and you are **required** to propose specific actions and/or language that would resolve your objection. 
* Editorial comments are informative and do not require a formal response by the project group for each suggestion. Multiple editorial changes may be suggested in a single issue.
